4-Fold CV

Each fold (0,1,2,3) has a train partition and a test partition.
The train partition consists of a train set and a validation set.
The model is trained on the train set, and performance during training checked on the validation set.
The best model, in reference to the validation partition, is saved. This is then tested on the test set. After training is DONE.
